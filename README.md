# Taxonomy of Mathematical Plagiarism

This repository provides dataset published in the paper "Taxonomy of Mathematical Plagiarism" and performed experiment's code.

## Dataset

We curated dataset of potentially plagiarised document math content span pairs along with Obfuscation (way in which content is modifed) types.
Dataset and inormation on the accompanying files is available in "data/"

## Experiments

We analyzed the best-performing approaches to detect plagiarism and mathematical content similarity on the newly established taxonomy. Corresponding code is present in "code/experiments/".
